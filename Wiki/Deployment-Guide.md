# Installation Types (Customized vs Standard)

## Customized Installation
The customized installation makes the assumption you wish to change the default variables (site location, text or visual aspects, etc) with the Champion Management Platform. Customizing the installation takes it outside of 
configurations we have tested against but allows you to modify any aspect of the platform. Below are high level steps to get you started on a customized installation.

### Install NodeJs

1.  Download nodejs from this link 
    https://nodejs.org/ 

2.   Previous Releases | Node.js (nodejs.org) 
    Download node 10.24.0

3.  After downloading the nodejs and installing follow steps as follows

4.  Please open the CMP download folder
    Run Npm install
    And 
    Run npm install -g gulp
    
  *	Global or SharePoint Administrator role in the target tenant
  *	***ChampionManagementPlatform*** project in GitHub
    
### Customize configuration

If desired the administrator can configure the installation location including the customized site, list, and/or column(s) using following steps:

1.	Update the ***"src/webparts/XXXXX/config/siteconfig.json"*** configuration file. Changing the values in the JSON file will customize the SharePoint list location and/or schema when it is created during deployment.
 <br/>

```
· inclusionPath (SharePoint inclusion path - e.g. sites or teams)

· sitename (SharePoint site name)

· list (SharePoint list for maintaining Champions)

· CName (SharePoint list Column Name for Champions)
```
<br/>

2.	Create the SharePoint App Package. This package will be used to deploy the application in SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. Run the below commands :

```
· npm install 

· gulp build

· gulp bundle --ship

· gulp package-solution --ship
```

3.	Navigate to the solution folder where you cloned and locate the newly created ***cmp.sppkg*** package in ***"sharepoint/solution"***.


## Standard Installation
The standard installation assumes you would like to take the SharePoint package file located in our GitHub repository and install using the configuration outlined in this readme file (assets all created under a SharePoint site
called ChampionManagementPlatform as well as the default list names and all related teamwork champion terms within the application)

Continuing below steps you can take the cmp.sppkg file from the ***cmp.sppkg*** package in ***"sharepoint/solution"*** location of the GitHub repo here (or use the one customized for your organization if someone provided a customized file)

### First Run Experience:Add ***Champion Management Platform*** Tab in Teamst

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Please wait for around 20 minutes for API access approvals done in the previous section to take effect before proceeding with the below steps.

1.	Navigate to Microsoft teams, select the Team and channel where you want to install Champion Management Platform. Click ***Add a tab***, choose ***Champion Management Platform*** from the app list, and Save. (Search for Champion)

Alternately you can also add the Champion Management Platform as a personal app in the left side rail by selecting the “...” and searching for Champion Management Platform, and then selecting add. 
 
This first run experience needs to be completed by the person who will be an admin of the platform, as it is this experience that creates the initial resources (SPO site + assets (3 lists mentioned above). This user that completes the first run is added as a manager of the platform. Alternately you may need a SharePoint admin to run the first run so the site is created and then have them add you as a manager of the platform once the assets have been created.
